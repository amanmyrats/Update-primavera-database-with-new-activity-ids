# Update-primavera-database-with-new-activity-ids
This code will take newly created activity IDs, and send them to primavera database and update it.

First we fetch all existing activities with their then assigned activity IDs. Then we generate new activity IDs with special activity
  ID generator(which is my anothor repository).
Then we send it back to primavera database.

*I could not upload my sample excel file here, if anyone know how to do it, please let me know.
